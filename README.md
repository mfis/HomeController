# HomeController

Home automation application *Backend*.
Corresponding between HomematicCCU/Historian and Home *Frontend*.

Commented application.properties needed to be configured in external 'homecontroller.properties'

Sources in /domain/ -packages are depending on individual Homematic setup and therefore needed to be changed.

Application is based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (not included).
